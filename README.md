# warriors-battle

The project is incomplete and not at his final stage.

A simple command-line battle with warriors uuuh i'm too lazy to make a proper README for now so have fun reading the code.

# short-explanation

Fight between 2 fighters, the gameplay is made out of turns, where the warrior choices the action to do like
attack, defense, parry, where attacking deals damage and uses STAMINA, defendig reduces the damage taken and restores 
some stamina and for last and not least parrying has a change to stun the enemy both the success or failure of parrying
gives stamina.

Bruh i'll do a better read me in the future, sorry for the bad english me retarded.
